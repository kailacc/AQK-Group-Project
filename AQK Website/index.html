            <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
            Legend has it that a woman running away from her despotic husband, ran into the forest and climbed up a banyan tree. As her husband followed her up, she tied lianas to her ankles and jumped down. The lianas broke her fall and she survived. Her husband didn't tie himself and so his jump caused his death, thus gaining the woman's freedom. As such, the 'land diving' (Nanggol) festival developed in her honor, and each year around the yam harvest season in the springtime, local villagers erect 20-30m constructions from which 9 men dive.
            <br>
            The constructions are made from wood, and the divers are only tied by their feet with vines. The festival is specific to this time of the year because it is the driest, and the vines are most elastic. Because of the lack of harness, accidents can happen when vines break and can sometimes result in serious injury. Historically it is believed that men brave enough to dive from the top secure the village a good yam crop and prosperity for the community, and it also signifies the progression to manhood.
            <br>
            Land diving is actually the predecessor of bungee diving, as A.J. Hackett invented the sport after witnessing this amazing feat of courage and endurance.

          <img src="./images/hermanus-whale-festival.jpg" alt="Image of a Whale" width="500px">
          <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
          The story goes that in the 1930s, a female southern right whale got beached in a small town in South Africa called Hermanus. All the villagers gathered together to help the whale get back into the sea. Year after year she returned to the cove to say hello to her rescuers, and the villagers adopted her as one of the 'family' and named her Wendy.
          <br>
          Wendy the Whale's legacy lives on to this day in the form of the Hermanus Whale Watching festival, which happens every year in September. The festival coincides with the return of Southern Right whales to South Africa's shores. It represents man's ability and necessity to live in harmony with nature, valuing the environment, and coming together as a community for the greater good.
          <br>
          During about a week of celebrations, locals and tourists come together to watch the wales' return, learn about conservation efforts and sustainability drives, watch the whale-themed street parade, listen to Marine Mammal and Eco talks, and much more. It is a magical few days whose focus point are these gentle and delicate creatures, and above all the festival aims to create awareness and appreciation of the rich life our marine ecosystem has to offer!

    <h3 class="asia_subtitle">Magh Mela Festival India</h3>
    <p class="asia_text">Magh mela, also spelled Magha mela, is an annual festival with fairs held in the month of Magha (January/February) near river banks and sacred tanks near Hindu temples.[1] About every twelve years, Magha melas coincide with what is believed by faithful as an astrologically auspicious position of Jupiter, sun and moon, and these are called the Kumbh Mela such as the one at Allahabad (officially, Prayagraj). In the south, a notable festival is at the Mahamaham tank in Kumbhakonam; in the east, at Sagar island of West Bengal and Konark, Puri.
        The Magha festival, along with the bathing rituals as a form of penance, is also observed by the Hindu community in Bali, Indonesia.[4]
        Certain dates such as the Amavasya and the Makar Sankranti are considered particularly sacred, attracting a larger gathering. The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community commerce with fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, dāna and community meals for the monks and the poor, and entertainment spectacle.
        The religious basis for the Magh Mela is the belief that pilgrimage is a means for prāyaścitta (atonement, penance) for past mistakes,[6] the effort cleanses them of sins and that bathing in holy rivers at these festivals has a salvific value, moksha – a means to liberation from the cycle of rebirths (samsara).[7][8] According to Diane Eck – professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, these festivals are "great cultural fairs" which brings people together, tying them with a shared thread of religious devotion, with an attendant bustle of commerce, trade and secular entertainment.[9]</p>

    <h3 class="europe_subtitle">Oktoberfest</h3>
    <p class="europe_text">Oktoberfest is the world's largest Volksfest. Held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, it is a 16- to 18-day folk festival running from mid or late September to the first Sunday in October, with more than six million people from around the world attending the event every year. Locally, it is often called the Wiesn, after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, Theresa's meadows (Theresienwiese). The Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture, having been held since the year 1810. Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations that are modeled after the original Munich event.
    During the event, large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed: during the 16-day festival in 2013, for example, 7.7 million litres (66,000 US bbl; 1,700,000 imp gal) were served.[1] Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.
    The Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to German reunification. As such, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October (German Unity Day). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial.</p>
