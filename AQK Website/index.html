            <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
            Legend has it that a woman running away from her despotic husband, ran into the forest and climbed up a banyan tree. As her husband followed her up, she tied lianas to her ankles and jumped down. The lianas broke her fall and she survived. Her husband didn't tie himself and so his jump caused his death, thus gaining the woman's freedom. As such, the 'land diving' (Nanggol) festival developed in her honor, and each year around the yam harvest season in the springtime, local villagers erect 20-30m constructions from which 9 men dive.
            <br>
            The constructions are made from wood, and the divers are only tied by their feet with vines. The festival is specific to this time of the year because it is the driest, and the vines are most elastic. Because of the lack of harness, accidents can happen when vines break and can sometimes result in serious injury. Historically it is believed that men brave enough to dive from the top secure the village a good yam crop and prosperity for the community, and it also signifies the progression to manhood.
            <br>
            Land diving is actually the predecessor of bungee diving, as A.J. Hackett invented the sport after witnessing this amazing feat of courage and endurance.

      <h3 class="festival_dates">Dates: 24-27 September 2020</h3>
        <p class="africa_text">
          <img src="./images/hermanus-whale-festival.jpg" alt="Image of a Whale" width="500px">
          <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
          The story goes that in the 1930s, a female southern right whale got beached in a small town in South Africa called Hermanus. All the villagers gathered together to help the whale get back into the sea. Year after year she returned to the cove to say hello to her rescuers, and the villagers adopted her as one of the 'family' and named her Wendy.
          <br>
          Wendy the Whale's legacy lives on to this day in the form of the Hermanus Whale Watching festival, which happens every year in September. The festival coincides with the return of Southern Right whales to South Africa's shores. It represents man's ability and necessity to live in harmony with nature, valuing the environment, and coming together as a community for the greater good.
          <br>
          During about a week of celebrations, locals and tourists come together to watch the wales' return, learn about conservation efforts and sustainability drives, watch the whale-themed street parade, listen to Marine Mammal and Eco talks, and much more. It is a magical few days whose focus point are these gentle and delicate creatures, and above all the festival aims to create awareness and appreciation of the rich life our marine ecosystem has to offer!

        <br>
        <img src="./images/lanternchina.jpg" alt="image of lantern" width="500px">
        <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
        Beginning over 2000 years ago, the festival has developed many meanings. It celebrates family reunions and society. It features ancient spiritual traditions. Some also call this the “true” Chinese Valentine’s Day.
        The many activities include moon gazing, lighting lanterns, riddles, lion dances and eating rice balls. According to the lunar calendar, the festival takes place on January 15. Dates of past and future Lantern Festivals using the Gregorian calendar include.
        <br>
        As China is a vast country with a long history and diverse cultures, Lantern Festival customs and activities vary regionally including lighting and enjoying (floating, fixed, held, and flying) lanterns, appreciating the bright full moon, setting off fireworks, flying drones, guessing riddles written on lanterns, eating tangyuan, lion dances, dragon dances, and walking on stilts.
        <br>
        The Lantern Festival may originate as far back as the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE), when Buddhist monks would light lanterns on the 15th day of the lunar year in honour of the Buddha. The rite was later adopted by the general population and spread throughout China and other parts of Asia. A legend concerning the festival’s origin tells the tale of the Jade Emperor (You Di), who became angered at a town for killing his goose. He planned to destroy the town with fire, but he was
        thwarted by a fairy who advised the people to light lanterns across the town on the appointed day of destruction.</p>

          <img src="./images/coachella.jpg" alt="Image of a mardigras" width="500px">
          <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
          The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.
          On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
          In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
          New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
          The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
          By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous. </p>

        <img src="./images/boomtown.jpg" alt="Image of Boomtown" width="500px">
        <h3><u>About The Festival</u></h3>
        The festival is split up into four main areas: Downtown, Hilltop, Temple Valley and Whistlers Green. Within these areas are our distinct districts: Kidztown, Whistlers Green, Oldtown, Copper County, Paradise Heights, AREA 404, Metropolis, DSTRKT 5 and Barrio Loco.  Each district has at least one main stage and a selection of smaller street or theatrical venues as well as small and medium-sized music venues. The large stages of Lion’s Den, Town Centre, and RELIC differ from standard districts as they are designed to accommodate crowds several thousand strong, with vast stage sets at the centre with food and drink courts in their arenas. On top of the district venues and main arenas, scattered throughout the festival are our four forest parties: Hidden Woods, Psy Forest, Tangled Roots and Tribe of Frog.
        <br>
        In addition to the hundreds of musical artists on the bill, our ongoing storyline evolves each year along with the layout and set design of the festival to create an intricate and detailed world within a world. A theatrically-led experience like no other, curated by our supremely experienced in-house theatrical team and the theatrical production crews, they shape and encourage the hundreds of actors to bring the film-like street sets to life, and inspire our attendees (citizens) to become their inner character and be part of the story themselves!</p>
