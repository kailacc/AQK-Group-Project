Oceania: Vanuatu
Naghol Land Diving Festival
Dates: April-May-June 2020
About the festival:
  - Legend has it that a woman running away from her despotic husband, ran into the forest and climbed up a banyan tree. As her husband followed her up, she tied lianas to her ankles and jumped down. The lianas broke her fall and she survived. Her husband didn't tie himself and so his jump caused his death, thus gaining the woman's freedom. As such, the 'land diving' (Nanggol) festival developed in her honor, and each year around the yam harvest season in the springtime, local villagers erect 20-30m constructions from which 9 men dive. the constructions are made from wood, and the divers are only tied by their feet with vines. the festival is specific to this time of the year because it is the driest, and the vines are most elastic. because of the lack of harness, accidents can happen when vines break and can sometimes result in serious injury. historically it is believed that men brave enough to dive from the top secure the village a good yam crop and prosperity for the community, and it also signifies the progression to manhood. land diving is actually the predecessor of bungee diving, as A.J. Hackett invented the sport after witnessing this amazing feat of courage and endurance.

Africa: South Africa
Hermanus Whale Festival
Dates: 24-27 September 2020
About the festival:
  - The story goes that in the 1930s, a female southern right whale got beached in a small town in South Africa called Hermanus. All the villagers gathered together to help the whale get back into the sea. Year after year she returned to the cove to say hello to her rescuers, and the villagers adopted her as one of the 'family' and named her Wendy. Wendy the Whale's legacy lives on to this day in the form of the Hermanus Whale Watching festival, which happens every year in September. The festival coincides with the return of Southern Right whales to South Africa's shores. It represents man's ability and necessity to live in harmony with nature, valuing the environment, and coming together as a community for the greater good. During about a week of celebrations, locals and tourists come together to watch the wales' return, learn about conservation efforts and sustainability drives, watch the whale-themed street parade, listen to Marine Mammal and Eco talks, and much more. It is a magical few days whose focus point are these gentle and delicate creatures, and above all the festival aims to create awareness and appreciation of the rich life our marine ecosystem has to offer!
